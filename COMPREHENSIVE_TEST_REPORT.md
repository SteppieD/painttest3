# PaintQuote Pro - Comprehensive Test Report

## Executive Summary

I've conducted a thorough analysis and testing of the PaintQuote Pro application, focusing on the dashboard functionality, free vs premium features, and quote creation system. Here's what I found:

### ✅ What's Working
1. **Authentication System** - Login and signup functionality works correctly
2. **Quote Calculator** - Properly calculates costs with overhead, profit, and tax
3. **Free/Premium Feature Separation** - Clear distinction in the UI
4. **Quote Limit Logic** - Code is in place to enforce 5 quotes/month for free users

### ❌ Current Issues
1. **Dashboard Error** - Fixed in code but container running old version
2. **Quote Creation** - Failing due to duplicate quote numbers in test environment

- Adds overhead (15%), profit margin (30%), and tax (8.25%)

**Free Plan Limitations:**
- 5 quotes per month
