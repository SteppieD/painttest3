# PaintQuote Pro - Production Deployment Guide

## Project Status Summary

PaintQuote Pro is a Next.js 14-based SaaS application for painting contractors that helps generate professional quotes in 10-15 minutes using AI assistance.

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Database Migration** - Successfully migrated from Prisma to SQLite adapter pattern
2. **API Endpoints** - All core endpoints tested and working:
   - Health check: `/api/health`
   - Authentication: `/api/auth/verify-code`, `/api/auth/signin`
   - Quote management: `/api/quotes`
   - AI integration: `/api/test-ai` (requires OpenRouter API key)
   - Stripe billing: `/api/stripe/*` endpoints configured

3. **Environment Configuration** - Created comprehensive `.env.production.example` with all required variables
4. **Docker Configuration** - Set up `docker-compose.yml` for containerized deployment
5. **Stripe Integration** - Test keys configured and endpoints created

### 🚧 Known Issues

1. **Docker Build** - The production Docker build has issues with static generation of dynamic routes. Recommendation: Deploy using standard Node.js deployment methods or use Vercel/Railway.

2. **Client-Side Imports** - Fixed issue where server-side database code was imported in client components by creating API endpoints.

### 🚀 Deployment Options

#### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel --prod
```

#### Option 2: Traditional Node.js Deployment
```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start
```

#### Option 3: Docker (Development)
```bash
# Use docker-compose for development
docker-compose up -d
```

### 📋 Environment Variables Required

Critical variables for production:

1. **Database**
   - `DATABASE_PATH` or Supabase credentials
   
2. **Authentication**
   - `JWT_SECRET` - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` - Generate with: `openssl rand -base64 32`

3. **AI Services** (Required for chat features)
   - `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - Get from https://openrouter.ai/

4. **Payments** (Required for subscriptions)
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - Stripe Price IDs for each plan

5. **Email** (Required for notifications)
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` - Get from https://resend.com/

### 🔧 Quick Start for Production

1. **Clone and prepare**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository>
   cd painttest4
   cp .env.production.example .env.production
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   - Edit `.env.production` with your actual values
   - Ensure all required API keys are set

3. **Install and build**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Start production server**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production npm start
   ```

### 📊 Database Setup

The application uses SQLite by default with automatic initialization. For production with PostgreSQL/Supabase:

1. Set up Supabase project
2. Run the schema from `lib/database/unified-schema.sql`
3. Configure Supabase environment variables

### 🔒 Security Considerations

1. Always use HTTPS in production
2. Set strong JWT_SECRET and NEXTAUTH_SECRET
3. Configure CORS and rate limiting
4. Use environment-specific API keys
5. Enable monitoring and error tracking

### 📱 Features Verified

- ✅ Multi-tenant access via access codes
- ✅ Quote generation and management
- ✅ Customer tracking
- ✅ AI-powered chat (with OpenRouter)
- ✅ Stripe billing integration
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ SEO-optimized marketing pages

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

1. **Database connection issues**
   - Ensure SQLite file has write permissions
   - Check DATABASE_PATH is correct

2. **AI features not working**
   - Verify OPENROUTER_API_KEY is set
   - Check API key has sufficient credits

3. **Stripe errors**
   - Ensure all Stripe environment variables are set
   - Verify webhook endpoint is accessible

### 📞 Support

For deployment assistance or issues:
- Check logs: `npm run dev` for detailed error messages
- Database issues: Verify `painting_quotes_app.db` exists and is writable
- API issues: Check `/api/health` endpoint first

**Note**: This application is production-ready but requires proper environment configuration and API keys to function fully. The Docker build issues can be resolved by using alternative deployment methods like Vercel or traditional Node.js hosting.
