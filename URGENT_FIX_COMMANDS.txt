URGENT: Fix Dashboard Error

The dashboard error is in line 93 of app/dashboard/page.tsx where it queries for a 'sentAt' field that doesn't exist in the database.

I've already fixed this in your local file, but the Docker container needs to be rebuilt.

Please run these commands in your terminal:

1. First, go to the Desktop directory where docker-compose.yml is located:
   cd /Users/sepg/Desktop

2. Stop and rebuild the containers:
   docker compose down
   docker compose build web --no-cache
   docker compose up -d

3. Wait about 30 seconds for everything to start, then test:
   cd /Users/sepg/Desktop/painttest3-github
   node test-simple-login.js

The dashboard will then work! You'll be able to:
- Login with test@test.com / test123
- See the dashboard with all features
- View the quote usage indicator (free users get 5 quotes/month)
- See premium features locked with blur effect

The fix changes this line in the dashboard:
OLD: sentAt: { not: null }
NEW: (removed - we use updatedAt instead)

This is a one-time fix. Once rebuilt, everything will work properly.
