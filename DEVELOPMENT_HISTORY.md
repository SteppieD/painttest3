### Database Schema
Key models and relationships:
```prisma
User -> Company (many-to-one)
Company -> Quote (one-to-many)
Company -> Customer (one-to-many)
Company -> PaintProduct (one-to-many)
Quote -> Surface (one-to-many)
Quote -> Customer (many-to-one)
Customer -> Quote (one-to-many)
```

### AI Integration Architecture
- OpenRouter API for model flexibility
- Fallback from Anthropic to OpenRouter
- Natural language processing for quote extraction
- Structured data extraction from conversations

## üö® Important Implementation Details

### Authentication
- Custom JWT implementation (not NextAuth)
- Tokens stored in httpOnly cookies
- Middleware protection for dashboard routes
- Test user: test@paintquotepro.com / test123

### Environment Variables
Critical variables that must be set:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/paintquotepro"
JWT_SECRET="your-secure-secret"
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-xxxxx"
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="placeholder-or-real-key"
```

### Docker Configuration
- Uses paintquotepro-web_default network
- Database container: paintquotepro-db
