# Next Steps to Complete Testing

## Immediate Actions Required

### 1. Fix Dashboard Error
The dashboard code has been fixed in `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`:
- Changed `sentAt` to `updatedAt` in the query
- This fix needs to be deployed to the running container

### 2. Rebuild Docker Containers
From the parent directory containing docker-compose.yml:
```bash
cd /Users/sepg/Desktop
docker compose down
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### 3. Clear Database (if needed)
If quote creation fails due to duplicate numbers:
```bash
docker exec paintquotepro-db psql -U paintquote -d postgres -c "DELETE FROM quotes;"
docker exec paintquotepro-db psql -U paintquote -d postgres -c "UPDATE companies SET \"quotesUsed\" = 0;"
```

### 4. Run Comprehensive Test
After rebuilding:
```bash
cd /Users/sepg/Desktop/painttest3-github
node test-comprehensive.js
```
